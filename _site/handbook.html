<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>
    BuddyPress Courseware can be downloaded and installed manually
    <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-courseware/">from
    official WordPress plugins directory</a>, or using plugin installation
    utility from <em>WordPress &rarr; Plugins &rarr; Add New</em> and search
    for it's name, after what just follow the standard installation procedure.
</p>
<p>
    If you are installing it manually, you need to extract the <tt>zip</tt>
    file contents and then upload the resulted directory (should be named
    buddypress-courseware) into <tt>wp-content/plugins/</tt> using your
    <acronym title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</acronym> or
    <acronym title="Secure File Transfer Protocol">SFTP</acronym> client.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/plugins.png" alt="Plugins Screen" />
<p>
    Once you got it installed, go to <em>WordPress &rarr; Plugins</em> and
    activate the plugin.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>
    Once installed and activated, BuddyPress Courseware offers some configuration
    options, which are useful if you want to tweak the system's behaviour.
    These settings are not required, I mean Courseware will work out-of-the-box
    anyway, but enabling some of them can offer you features like:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/options.png" alt="Options Screen" />
<ul>
    <li>Globally enable courseware</li>
    <li>Switch between European and US learning models</li>
    <li>Collaboration settings</li>
    <li>Gradebook default grade format</li>
    <li>Webservices for bibliography fetching and formating</li>
    <li>Customization options</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All these options are well documented and can be accessed by going to
    <em>WordPress &rarr; BuddyPress &rarr; Courseware</em>.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/per_group.png" alt="Per Group Option" />
<p>
    BuddyPress Courseware can be enabled globally or per group. This allows you to
    turn on and off courseware component for every group.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="roles">Roles: Students and Teachers</h2>
<p>
    Courseware uses custom roles to differentiate students from teachers.
</p>
<p>
    While existing users are easily treated as students after Courseware
    installation, teachers, must be defined. We designed a special moderation
    tool for that, that allows both: manual roles definition and by sending a
    request.
</p>
<p>
    An ordinary user can send a request to become a teacher by going to
    <em>Profile &rarr; Edit Profile &rarr; Courseware Tab</em>.
    There, he will find 2 options:
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/role_choices.png" alt="Roles Screen" />
<ol>
    <li>Student</li>
    <li>Apply for Teacher</li>
</ol>
<p>
    By selecting 2nd option, this will autmatically send a request containing
    your username and profile link to the site admin. This will review both,
    and using the link in the message, will be able to set you a different role.
</p>
<p>
    Site admin, can also visit manually every profile, and edit user's role.
</p>
<p>
    Once you get the Teacher's role, this will allow you managing the groups
    where you are admin as your own classes. The whole BuddyPress Courseware
    is built on BuddyPress Groups concept, in fact once you installed it,
    a BuddyPress Group can be named now a Class of students. All the Courseware
    features will use per group settings, each group will has its own data,
    though, some informations like <a href="#bibliography">Bibliography</a>
    are globally shared.
</p>
<h4 id="roles-warning">Important!</h4>
<p>
    By default Courseware will require both, a user to have teacher role and
    to be group admin to be able to manage a class/group courseware.
    To disable this (meaning a teacher will be able to manage courseware
    immediately he gets the teacher role), check the 
    <em>Allow any teacher to contribute to class Courseware content</em> option
    available on the Courseware settings under <em>Collaboration settings</em>
    section.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>
<p>
    Dashboard is the homepage for students and teachers when they visit the
    <em>Courseware</em> Tab on group page. The Dashboard concept is stolen
    from WordPress.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/dashboard_student.png" alt="Student Dashboard Screen" />
<p>
    For students it will reflect all
    the group activity, and some of their progress (the grades they obtained
    will generate a small chart at the bottom of the page).
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/dashboard.png" alt="Teacher Dashboard Screen" />
<p>
    For teachers the dashboard will serve also the latest information about
    students activity and class content and will add quick links to add new
    content to the group.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="courses">Courses</h2>
<p>
    Courses or Course (depends on EU/US Courseware settings), is the main
    content type, on group creation, adding/updating a course is the first
    step a teacher has to do. The Course content should reflect the most
    important informations and details for futher class activity.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/course_info.png" alt="Course Screen" />
<img src="/assets/img/screens/edit_course.png" alt="Edit Course Screen" />
<p>
    Courses are integrated with Bibliography, so you won't need to add
    bibliography notes to it's content, since it can be added later by using
    <em><a href="#bibliography">Bibliography</a></em> button.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>
    Assignments should reflect teacher's interest from students/courseware
    participants. These should contain homework tasks, course exercises,
    todo's and other notes a teacher want's students to get aware of.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/assignment_info.png" alt="Assignment Screen" />
<img src="/assets/img/screens/assignments_list.png" alt="Assignments List Screen" />
<p>
    Assignments are integrated with Bibliography, so you won't need to add
    bibliography notes to it's content, since it can be added later by using
    <em><a href="#bibliography">Bibliography</a></em> button.
</p>
    <h4 id="responses">Responses</h4>
    <p>
        Assignments will automatically enable responses for students. Responses
        get listed below assignment content by using <em>Responses</em>
        button on an assignment page. A student will find one of the
        <em>Add a Response</em> or <em>Your Response</em> buttons on assignment
        page. First if he didn't add a response yet, and the button will bring him
        to the editor screen. And the second if he already added a response
        and now he can review his response.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/screens/add_response.png" alt="Add Response Screen" />
    <p>
        Responses are a way of students involvement in courseware processes.
        By responding to an assignment, student's answer can be used as a
        possible solution that will result into a grade a teacher can add
        later.
    </p>
    <p>
        Responses are a one way functionality. (Currently), a student
        can add only <em>one</em> response per assignment. He's not allowed
        to edit or delete it, all he gets is a public permalink to his response.
        His response now will serve as a proof.
    </p>
    <p>
        Assignment teacher/author, gets a notification once a student responded.
        Teachers are not allowed to edit student responses, but they can delete
        them, by this allowing a student to make a new response to current
        assignment. Teachers as students can later review anytime the existing
        responses.
    </p>
    <h4 id="gradebook">Gradebook</h4>
    <p>
        Every assignment gets a gradebook. A gradebook will contain all the
        group/class users/students and offer controls to add grade, grade format,
        public and private comment to each one.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/screens/gradebook.png" alt="Gradebook Screen" />
    <p>
        Gradebook can also be imported from a
        <acronym title="Comma Separated Value">CSV</acronym> file. Such a file
        must look like the example below for username <tt>test</tt>:
    </p>
        <pre>
uid,value,format,prv_comment,pub_comment
test,10,numeric,"Private comment text","Public comment text"
        </pre>
    <p>
        To import the gradebook from a file, use the <em>Import from CSV</em>
        button. <strong>Remember</strong>, the data from CSV,
        will not be stored until you click <em>Save grades</em> button.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every time a student grade is being changed, he will receive a
        notification with the assignment link. Assignment page will contain
        his grade information.
    </p>
    <h4 id="forum">Forum integration</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Warning</strong>: this option requires group forums enabled.
        To do that, you will need to visit
        <em>Group page &rarr; Admin &rarr; Group Settings</em>
        and check the <em>Enable discussion forum</em> checkbox.
    </p>
    <p>
        Assignments might require additional information or questions from
        students, so we added an option to allow teachers and students exchange
        such informations by using BuddyPress Forums.
        A teacher will find on assignment page, a button
        <em>Enable Assignment Forum</em>, that will instantly create a topic
        with assignment content in group forums. Next time somebody will
        visit the same page, will be able to get to assignment forum by
        using <em>Visit Assignment Forum</em> button.
    </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="schedules">Schedules</h2>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/schedules.png" alt="Schedules Screen" />
<p>
    Schedules are a way of creating timetables for students, or events like
    exam/test announcements, class hour changes etc.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/calendar.png" alt="Calendar Screen" />
<p>
    Calendar is the most dynamic part of the Courseware. The calendar will
    reflect all the assignment and schedules with their start dates, due dates
    and end dates. Calendar can be used for day/week/month views.
    There's also an <acronym title="vCalendar File">ICS</acronym> export option
    that can integrate calendar contents with your email client or
    Google Calendar.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2>
<p>
    Bibliography should help teachers add book/author refferences to courses
    and assignments. It integrates tightly with both.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/bibs.png" alt="Bibliography Screen" />
<p>
    There are several types of bibliography you can add manually or by using
    specific webservices like <a href="http://isbndb.com/">ISBNdb</a> and
    <a href="http://worldcat.org/">WorldCat</a>.
    Also you can add webpages, as refferences. The last two methods are available
    on course and assignment page just by clicking
    <em>Bibliography &rarr; Quick Add Book/Webpage</em>
    buttons, the manual method for bibliography is available only by visiting
    <em>Courseware Bibliography Tab</em>.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/quick_bib.png" alt="Quick Add Bibliography Screen" />
<p>
    Bibliography content is shared globally inside BuddyPress, so any other
    teacher will be able to use existing/added entry with his courses/assignments.
    Adding an entry to existing course/assignment allows you to edit it later,
    this way making it relevant for you content.
    You can also update a global entry, using the same page
    <em>Courseware Bibliography Tab</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Bibliography can also be imported by using a BibTeX file. To do that,
    use the <em>Import Bibliography</em> button and paste your BibTeX content.
</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="streams">Activity streams</h2>
<p>
    BuddyPress Courseware is tightly integrated with group activity, so that
    the courseware content will generate a specific stream. Later you can
    subscribe to group's feed to be up to date with all the activities.
</p>
<img src="/assets/img/screens/activity_streams.png" alt="Activity Streams Screen" />
<p>
    Here's the list of activity streams Courseware creates:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>New Forum Topics</li>
    <li>New Courses</li>
    <li>New Assignments</li>
    <li>New Schedules</li>
    <li>New Responses</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All should be visible on the group homepage.
</p>
<hr />
